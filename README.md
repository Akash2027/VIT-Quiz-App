## ⚡ Local Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to run the portal locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Akash2027/VIT-Quiz-App.git](https://github.com/Akash2027/VIT-Quiz-App.git)
cd VIT-Quiz-App

```


2. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install

```


3. **Configure Firebase Credentials:**
Ensure your `src/firebase.js` matches your Firebase console web app initialization config with the necessary `auth` and `db` exports.
4. **Run the Development Server:**
```bash
npm run dev

```

## 🌐 Real-World Deployment

### 1. Cloud Firestore Rules Configuration

To allow the client application to sync metrics securely, configure your database rules in the Firebase Console under **Firestore Database > Rules**:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}

```

### 2. Single Page Application (SPA) Routing on Vercel

To prevent `404 Not Found` errors when refreshing sub-routes like `/dashboard` or `/result` on live URLs, ensure a `vercel.json` file is present in the root directory:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}

```
